## Examples

## Installation

```sh
pip install bigquery-erd
```

`ERAlchemy` requires [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/download) to generate the graphs and Python. Both are available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Usage

### Usage from Python

Find an example notebook [here](./notebooks/example.py).

## But Wait, BigQuey is not a Relation Database?

That's right.
